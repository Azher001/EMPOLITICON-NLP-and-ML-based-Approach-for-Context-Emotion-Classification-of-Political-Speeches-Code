This repository primarily contains the source code used in developing models for context and emotion classification of text based Political Speeches

Published Paper - [**EMPOLITICON: NLP and ML Based Approach for Context and Emotion Classification of Political Speeches From Transcripts**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141612).

While conducting this research we had to create our own dataset.

Dataset used: [EMPOLITICON: Political Speeches-Context & Emotion](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/efatazher/empoliticon-political-speeches-context-and-emotion)

### Steps to recreate the model:

**Step 1:** Initial preprocessing was done on the dataset.

**Step 2:** Embedding generated using Longformer.

**Step 3:** Model trained for emotion and context classification.
